# Guide to writing prompts for product development

## 1. General Provisions

### 1.1. Preface

Based on practical experience in developing and implementing prompts in project/product systems, I would like to share key principles and approaches to their creation. This guide is a systematic look at the process of developing prompts, based on both generally accepted practices and the unique experience of the author and our team.

It is important to note that Prompt Engineering is a dynamically developing field, where new approaches and techniques are constantly emerging. Therefore, the structure of Prompts presented in this guide is flexible and can be adapted to specific tasks. In addition to the basic sections described, the authors can add additional sections necessary to solve specific problems.

In our practice, we set the target indicator of prompt accuracy at 70%. This threshold was chosen based on the analysis of a large number of practical tasks and represents the optimal balance between the quality of results and the stability of the system. On the one hand, this level of accuracy is sufficient for most applied tasks, on the other hand, it allows us to avoid overtraining and excessive specificity of prompts.

The systematization of the prompt structure presented in this guide is aimed primarily at increasing the stability of the language model responses. Regular monitoring of the results and iterative adjustments to the prompts is a mandatory part of the process of their development and support.

This version of the guide is relevant for the Llama (Meta), Qwen (Alibaba), Mistral (Mixtral), YI (零一万物) and Megatron (Nvidia) model families. The principles are primarily designed for 13b, 34b and 70b models, but also work for larger ones.

For any questions related to the use of this guide, development and optimization of prompts, as well as access to examples of specific implementations, you can contact Danila Katalshov (@adanman).

### 1.2. Purpose of the document
